//The best case input is an array that is already sorted. In this case insertion sort has a linear running time (i.e., Î˜(n)).
// During each iteration, the first remaining element of the input is only compared with the right-most element of the sorted subsection of the array.
// The simplest worst case input is an array sorted in reverse order.
// The set of all worst case inputs consists of all arrays where each element is the smallest or second-smallest of the elements before it.
// In these cases every iteration of the inner loop will scan and shift the entire sorted subsection of the array before inserting the next element.
// This gives insertion sort a quadratic running time (i.e., O(n2)).
// The average case is also quadratic, which makes insertion sort impractical for sorting large arrays.
// However, insertion sort is one of the fastest algorithms for sorting very small arrays, even faster than quicksort;
// indeed, good quicksort implementations use insertion sort for arrays smaller than a certain threshold, also when arising as subproblems;
// the exact threshold must be determined experimentally and depends on the machine, but is commonly around ten.
